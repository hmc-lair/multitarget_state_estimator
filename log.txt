fixed att-rep single point model
- changed angle_diff to while instead of if loop

run single point model PF (to find error over time)
- TODO: define steady state error point

modularize code so pf is separate from simulation

starting att-rep line model
-only need to change find attraction?

- Performance Metrics
	- Error
	- Add randomness
	- Based on number of sharks or sharksâ€™ speed
- Theory in the future
	- Likelihood of visiting each cell
	- Amount of time taken for shark to cover
	- Transition Model
- Did att_line PF
