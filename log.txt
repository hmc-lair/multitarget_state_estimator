fixed att-rep single point model
- changed angle_diff to while instead of if loop

run single point model PF (to find error over time)
- TODO: define steady state error point

modularize code so pf is separate from simulation

starting att-rep line model
-only need to change find attraction?

- Performance Metrics
	- Error
	- Add randomness
	- Based on number of sharks or sharksâ€™ speed
- Theory in the future
	- Likelihood of visiting each cell
	- Amount of time taken for shark to cover
	- Transition Model
- Did att_line PF

- Working on performance metrics
	- Where should the sharks start from
		- if start at zero, different time it takes to reach line
		- if random position, what is random
		- random within given distance from line??
- Matlab to PF 
	- matlab visualized on python
		- why are there lines?
